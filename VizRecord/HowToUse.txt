This file gives a bit of instructions about the project and how to use it (not indended as markdown file)

1) In the Form1.cs the Encoder class property ffmpePath needs to be specified to reflect your system path that
leads to the location of your ffmpeg executable.
Ffmpeg is availible under an open liscence at the following address: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
Scroll down to "release builds" and select the "ffmpeg-release-full.7z"
